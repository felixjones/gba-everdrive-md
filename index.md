## 9FC0010h - SD_CMD - Command (Read/Write)

Single byte commands can be written to this register.

The response of the last command is retrieved by reading this register.

Command arguments are sent in big-endian order.

```
  Bit   Expl.
  0-7   Command/response
```

### <a name="commandsummary"></a>SD Command Summary

```
  Code  Hex     Mnemonic                Basic Functions
  CMD0  40h     GO_IDLE_STATE           Software reset
  CMD1  41h     SEND_OP_COND            Brings card out of idle state
  CMD2  42h     ALL_SEND_CID            Reads the "card identification register" (CID)
  CMD3  43h     SEND_RELATIVE_ADDR      Reads the "relative card address register" (RCA)
  CMD6  46h                             Reserved
  CMD7  47h     SELECT/DESELECT_CARD    Toggles card between stand-by and transfer states
  CMD8  48h     SEND_IF_COND            Tell the SD card which voltages it must accept
  CMD9  49h     SEND_CSD                Reads the "card specific data" (CSD)
  CMD12 4Ch     STOP_TRANSMISSION       Stop transmission on multiple block read
  CMD17 51h     READ_SINGLE_BLOCK       Reads single block
  CMD18 52h     READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK     Reads multiple blocks
  CMD24 58h     WRITE_BLOCK             Writes single block
  CMD25 59h     WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK    Writes multiple blocks
  CMD41 69h                             Reserved
  CMD55 77h     APP_CMD                 Next command set to be an application command
  CMD58 7Ah     READ_OCR                Reads the "operation condition register" (OCR)
```

CMD55 sets the SD to expect an application specific command. Once an application specific command is sent the SD returns to its normal operation mode.

```
  Code      Hex     Mnemonic            Basic Functions
  ACMD6     46h     SET_BUS_WIDTH       Set 4-bit operation mode
  ACMD41    69h     SD_SEND_OP_COND     When accepted, the SD card will have left the idle-state
```

# <a name="data"></a>Data

## 9FC0012h - SD_DAT - Data (Read/Write)

Data is written as big-endian and received as big-endian. 8-bit reads requires endian re-ordering.

8-bit writes requires bits 8-15 to be set to FFh.

```
  Bit   Expl.
  0-7   "High" byte
  8-15  "Low" byte
```

## DMA write

Prepare 512 byte buffer.

Write 0 to SD_RAM.

Set SD_CFG mode to 4.

DMA transfer 512 bytes into SD_DAT.

## DMA read

Set SD_CFG mode to 4 with WAIT_F0 and STRT_F0 set.

Read SD_DAT.

Read STATUS until busy is unset.

If STATUS timeout is set: repeat. Else: transfer 512 bytes from SD_DAT.

## 9FC0016h - SD_RAM - RAM (Write)

Writing 0 to this register is required to enable writing via DMA.

## 9FC00B4h - KEY - Key (Write)

The value 00A5h must be written to this register to unlock all Everdrive GBA functionality.

```
  Bit   Expl.
  0-15  Everdrive unlock key
```

00A5h is the Unicode for the Yen currency symbol. This can be interpreted as the EASCII string "Â¥", with the high-byte being the NULL terminator.
